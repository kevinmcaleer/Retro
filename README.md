# Retro Console

![Image of the console](img/screen.png)

This project consists of three 3d printed parts:

| Filename                           | Description            |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|
| [`bottom.stl`](bottom.stl)         | The bottom of the case |
| [`Front_Case.stl`](Front_Case.stl) | The front section      |
| [`Shroud.stl`](Shroud.stl)         | The top cover          |

The screen used is a [Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4?variant=12569539706963), and the computer is a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The project can be battery powered using a pair of 18650s and a [diymore 18650 Battery Shield V8 3V 5V Micro USB Port Type-C USB for Raspberry Pi ESP32 ESP8266 Wifi](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0822Q4VS4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

The case fits together without the need for any glue or screws. The screen might need a couple of blobs of Blutac to hold it in place.
